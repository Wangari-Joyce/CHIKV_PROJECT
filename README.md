## COLLABORATORS OBJECTIVES
To reproduce [this paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6493958/) with an aim of getting hands on experience with while working with different bioinformatic tools specifically phylogenetic tools in the command line and also get familiar with command line languages such as bash and other programming languages such as python.

## OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY
- To analyze chikungunya virus genomes for the presence of adaptive mutations associated with both Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus
- To estimate origin and time of emergence of a variant that carried two of these previously reported mutations
- To estimate the time and origin of the Mandera chikungunya virus outbreak
